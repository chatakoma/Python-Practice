#JSon ===> working with JSON
#JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, human-readable text format for structuring and exchanging data, 
#widely used for sending data between servers and web/mobile apps because it's simple, language-independent, and easily parsed by computers,
#making it ideal for APIs, configuration files, and storing semi-structured data
