#Object-Oriented-Programming
#Creating a class
class Pet: 
    def __init__(self, name, health):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
    
    def take_damage(self, amount):
        self.health -= amount

#Using the class
p = Pet("Fluffly", 100)
p.take_damage(20)
print(p.health)



#Inheritance
#Here's one class can extend another
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Some sound")
        
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")
